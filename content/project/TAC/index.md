The Terrorism in Armed Conflict (TAC) project was developed to enable the study of terrorism within intrastate armed conflicts by uniting the most comprehensive available data sources from both research communities. TAC is led by [Page Fortna](http://www.columbia.edu/~vpf4/) (Columbia University) with [Nick Lotito](https://nicklotito.com) (Yale University) and [Mike Rubin](http://www.michaelarubin.com/) (University of Connecticut).

TAC brings together information from the most commonly used data set in the study of civil war, the [Uppsala Conflict Data Project](http://ucdp.uu.se/) (UCDP) Dyadic Dataset and the most comprehensive event data set on terrorism, [START’s Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) (GTD). The data set is designed to capture as much information as possible, and then to provide flexibility to the researcher to handle the uncertainty regarding assigning group responsibility to incidents.

Currently, TAC provides annual counts of the use of terrorism by 409 armed opposition groups in 166 intrastate conflicts in 96 countries from 1970-2013.

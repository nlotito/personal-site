abstract: "The Terrorism in Armed Conflict (TAC) project integrates the Uppsala
Conflict Data Project (UCDP) sample of rebel organizations with STARTâ€™s
Global Terrorism Database (GTD), covering 409 organizations 1970-
2013. Many GTD incidents are missing, or include ambiguous,
perpetrator information. Because the accuracy of perpetrator information
likely varies systematically, simply dropping these incidents from
analyses may bias results. TAC provides possible attribution to specific
rebel groups with coding for uncertainty, enabling researchers to 1)
address 'description bias' in media-based terrorism data, 2) model
uncertainty regarding perpetrator attribution, and 3) vary the way
terrorism is counted."

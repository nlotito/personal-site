Hi! I‚Äôm a political scientist studying civil-military relations and international security in North Africa and the Middle East. My current research focuses on the role of the military in [protest response]({{< relref "/project/soldiers" >}}), [public trust]({{< relref "/project/army-trust" >}}) in the army, and foreign [military assistance]({{< relref "/project/map" >}}). I also work on [terrorism]({{< relref "/project/tac" >}}) and extremist violence. At Princeton, I teach in the [School of Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu/) and the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu/). I'm the proud husband of [Liz Nugent](https://elizabethnugent.com) and father of two girls.
